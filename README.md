2. **Extract** the ZIP file to a permanent location (don't delete this folder after installation)

#### Common Questions

**Q: Why does it say "Developer mode extensions"?**
This is normal for manually installed extensions. It doesn't mean the extension is unsafe‚Äîjust that it wasn't installed from the store.

Yes! Once installed, it stays installed. Chrome/Edge may show a warning banner about developer mode extensions‚Äîyou can dismiss it.

**Q: How do I update manually installed extensions?**

## Privacy & Security

üìÑ **[Read our full Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md)**

**Your data stays local.** All prompts, settings, and saved conversations are stored in your browser's local storage. Nothing is sent to external servers.

**No API keys required.** The extension uses your existing browser login sessions. It loads the real AI websites in the sidebar using your cookies‚Äîjust like opening them in a new tab.

**No tracking.** The extension doesn't collect analytics, usage data, or any personal information. Zero telemetry.

**How it works technically:** The extension uses Chrome's `declarativeNetRequest` API to bypass X-Frame-Options headers, allowing AI provider websites to load in the sidebar iframe. This is the same security mechanism that extensions like password managers use. All code is open source and available for review.

**Cookie-based authentication:** When you log into an AI provider (like ChatGPT) in your browser, the extension can access those same login sessions to load the provider in the sidebar. Your credentials never pass through the extension‚Äîauthentication is handled entirely by the AI provider's website.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Issues

**The extension won't load**
Make sure you're using a recent version of Chrome (114+) or Edge (114+). Older versions don't support the required APIs.

**Extension icon doesn't appear in toolbar**
Click the puzzle piece icon in Chrome/Edge toolbar and pin "insidebar.ai" to make it always visible.

### AI Provider Issues

**An AI provider won't load in the sidebar**
1. First, visit that provider's website in a regular browser tab and log in
2. The extension needs an active login session to work
3. If still not working, try clearing your browser cache and cookies for that specific provider
4. Some providers may have regional restrictions or require specific account types

**Provider loads but shows login page**
Your session may have expired. Open the provider in a regular tab, log in again, then refresh the sidebar.

### Feature Issues

**Keyboard shortcuts don't work**
1. Check if another extension is using the same shortcut
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` (or `edge://extensions/shortcuts`)
3. View all shortcuts and change insidebar.ai shortcuts if needed
4. Some shortcuts may conflict with browser or OS hotkeys‚Äîtry different combinations

**Dark mode isn't working**
1. Open Settings (gear icon)
2. Check the Theme dropdown
3. If set to "Auto", it follows your system theme
4. Change to "Dark" to force dark mode regardless of system setting

**Prompt Library keyboard shortcut opens but stays blank**
1. Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
2. Try refreshing the sidebar
3. If using manual installation, ensure you're using the latest version

**Chat History save button doesn't appear**
1. Make sure you're viewing an actual conversation (not the AI's home screen)
2. The save button appears at the top of the chat interface
3. Currently supported: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek

**Update checking shows old version**
- **Chrome Web Store installation**: Update checking is disabled (the store handles updates automatically)
- **Manual installation**: Click "Check for Updates" in Settings to see if a newer version is available on GitHub

### Settings & Data

**Settings aren't saving**
Check if you have sufficient storage quota in your browser. Go to Settings ‚Üí Data Management to view storage usage.

**Lost all my prompts/settings**
If you cleared browser data or reinstalled the browser, local storage may have been wiped. This is why we recommend periodically exporting your data (Settings ‚Üí Data Management ‚Üí Export).

**Import fails with "Invalid JSON format"**
Ensure the file is valid JSON. Use a JSON validator if needed. For custom prompt libraries, check the structure matches the expected format (see `data/prompt-libraries/Generate_a_Basic_Prompt_Library.md`).
